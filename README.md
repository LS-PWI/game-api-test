# game-api-test
Simple web frontend to test if you have connection to the API

## HOW IT WORKS?
The home page has a button that makes a ping to the API.

If you have connection, a treasure and the links of Login and register, will appear. If not, it will appear a message saying that there is no connection. 

If you are connected, you'll be able to login and register in the same webpage.
